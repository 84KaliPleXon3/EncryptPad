<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Version 0.3.2.3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Configurable s2k iteration count. It can be set per file and the default value for new files. That value is also used for protecting file keys.</li>
<li>Support for the timestamp bytes in GPG files.</li>
<li>Renamed the executable to low case <code>encryptpad</code> except on Mac OS.</li>

<li>Added the <code>SHA-512</code> hashing algorithm.</li>
<li>CLI: resilience in edge cases when TTY is not available for input / output.</li>
<li>Bug fixed: In the file encryption dialogue, when clearing the passphrase and setting it again, the passphrase is ignored and the file is saved as "key only".</li>
<li>Bug fixed: In the file encryption, gpg files were encrypted with 't' flag. It lead to removal of 0x0D bytes when GPG decrypted the files because it thought that the files were textual.
